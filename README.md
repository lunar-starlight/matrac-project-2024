# Forcing on Cantor space for System T
## Project for course Matematika z Računalnikom

The main goal of this project was to use a forcing relation to compute a modulus of continuity for functionals of the form \((ℕ → 2) → 2\), that are definable in System T.
A further goal I set was to generalize this construction to functionals on the Baire space, i. e. of the form \((ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ\).

I mostly tried to follow Coquand's paper "A Computational Interpretation of Forcing in Type Theory".
